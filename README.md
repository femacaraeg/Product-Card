## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to build a webpage from scratch using plain HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript. When I was learning web development, I skipped to learning ReactJS and so I failed to grasp and learn the basics and building blocks of webpage building that's why I am now looking back to the core concepts and excercise building a webpage from scratch.

### Continued development

I am still mastering the skill of building responsive webpages. I still take my time in applying responsiveness that's why I try to exercise and build pages daily so that I can be more comfortable building responsive webpages in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Semantic HTML 5 Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) - This helped me understand the usage of semantic elements.
- [Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article to understand the concept of Flexbox. I personally like using flexbox when dealing with responsiveness.
